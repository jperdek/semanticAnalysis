Yes, every now and then a film comes out that nobody has heard of and ends up making money because of the stars, but it seems so few and far between these days. Netflix's Red Notice is the prime example of a generic action-comedy that's clearly banking on its leading performers. I'm a big fan of Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot has really grown on me as an actress too but based solely on the premise, I pretty much knew what to expect with this movie, and I was right. There is some fun to be had with Red Notice, but I'll probably forget I watched it a few months from now.  Working for the BAU, detective John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson)is in pursuit of the most wanted art thief in the world, Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). After Booth is captured and Hartley is double-crossed and ends up in prison with him, they eventually begin to work together to take down an even bigger thief in \"The Bishop\" (Gal Gadot). After a certain point, this film just started writing itself. I found myself rolling my eyes at the dumb stunts they were pulling off and all of the one-liners that you would expect from all of them. Yes, this cast has a lot of charisma with each other, but it wasn't enough to make it stand out from any other time I've ever seen them before.  Red Notice is a film that honestly has about an hour of story to tell, but the film really lets these performers do their thing, a lot. There were multiple times where scenes drag on and I firmly believe it was all improv. This was both equally enjoyable and annoying. I laughed consistently throughout the movie, but also while scratching my head and cringing. It was almost a frustrating watch at times, even though I still fall on the positive side of the movie overall. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also wrote the film, has always made films that ride the line of being both ridiculous and enjoyable, for the most part. I have a blast watching Dodgeball and We're the Millers and I've even enjoyed his work with Johnson on other projects like Central Intelligence or Skyscraper, but his films never take the extra step. Red Notice is by far his most ambitious film to date, I just think it's also the most he has ever had faith in his performers to run with the material however they like. As I said, I enjoyed myself, it's just riddled with soo many issues/inconsistencies.  In the end, Red Notice is one of the biggest films Netflix has ever released as an original film and while I'm all for them continuing to do big-budget movies like this, I also feel like they just see a big name and say yes to a project. This is why there are very few Netflix original films that end up being great. For those of you who like action, comedy, or any of these performers in general, I recommend checking out Red Notice but also try to go in knowing it's nothing special and you'll probably have a disposable good time as I did. There are far better films currently out, but if you open Netflix and start streaming this one, I'm sure you'll at least find some mild enjoyment in certain scenes at the very least. Red Notice is now streaming on Netflix.\r\n\r\nKJ P\r\nSUPER REVIEWER\r\nNov 18, 2021\r\nWaste of some really good talent in a badly scripted heist flick that's ridiculously lame."

Yes, every now and then a film comes out that nobody has heard of and ends up making money because of the stars, but it seems so few and far between these days. Netflix's Red Notice is the prime example of a generic action-comedy that's clearly banking on its leading performers. I'm a big fan of Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot has really grown on me as an actress too but based solely on the premise, I pretty much knew what to expect with this movie, and I was right. There is some fun to be had with Red Notice, but I'll probably forget I watched it a few months from now.  Working for the BAU, detective John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson)is in pursuit of the most wanted art thief in the world, Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). After Booth is captured and Hartley is double-crossed and ends up in prison with him, they eventually begin to work together to take down an even bigger thief in \"The Bishop\" (Gal Gadot). After a certain point, this film just started writing itself. I found myself rolling my eyes at the dumb stunts they were pulling off and all of the one-liners that you would expect from all of them. Yes, this cast has a lot of charisma with each other, but it wasn't enough to make it stand out from any other time I've ever seen them before.  Red Notice is a film that honestly has about an hour of story to tell, but the film really lets these performers do their thing, a lot. There were multiple times where scenes drag on and I firmly believe it was all improv. This was both equally enjoyable and annoying. I laughed consistently throughout the movie, but also while scratching my head and cringing. It was almost a frustrating watch at times, even though I still fall on the positive side of the movie overall. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also wrote the film, has always made films that ride the line of being both ridiculous and enjoyable, for the most part. I have a blast watching Dodgeball and We're the Millers and I've even enjoyed his work with Johnson on other projects like Central Intelligence or Skyscraper, but his films never take the extra step. Red Notice is by far his most ambitious film to date, I just think it's also the most he has ever had faith in his performers to run with the material however they like. As I said, I enjoyed myself, it's just riddled with soo many issues/inconsistencies.  In the end, Red Notice is one of the biggest films Netflix has ever released as an original film and while I'm all for them continuing to do big-budget movies like this, I also feel like they just see a big name and say yes to a project. This is why there are very few Netflix original films that end up being great. For those of you who like action, comedy, or any of these performers in general, I recommend checking out Red Notice but also try to go in knowing it's nothing special and you'll probably have a disposable good time as I did. There are far better films currently out, but if you open Netflix and start streaming this one, I'm sure you'll at least find some mild enjoyment in certain scenes at the very least. Red Notice is now streaming on Netflix.\r\n\r\nKJ P\r\nSUPER REVIEWER\r\nNov 18, 2021\r\nWaste of some really good talent in a badly scripted heist flick that's ridiculously lame."

Today, he’s teaching in a third-rate MFA program and struggling to maintain what’s left of his self-respect; he hasn’t written—let alone published—anything decent in years. When Evan Parker, his most arrogant student, announces he doesn’t need Jake’s help because the plot of his book in progress is a sure thing, Jake is prepared to dismiss the boast as typical amateur narcissism. But then . . . he hears the plot.\r\n\r\nJake returns to the downward trajectory of his own career and braces himself for the supernova publication of Evan Parker’s first novel: but it never comes. When he discovers that his former student has died, presumably without ever completing his book, Jake does what any self-respecting writer would do with a story like that—a story that absolutely needs to be told.\r\n\r\nIn a few short years, all of Evan Parker’s predictions have come true, but Jake is the author enjoying the wave. He is wealthy, famous, praised and read all over the world. But at the height of his glorious new life, an e-mail arrives, the first salvo in a terrifying, anonymous campaign: You are a thief, it says.\r\n\r\nAs Jake struggles to understand his antagonist and hide the truth from his readers and his publishers, he begins to learn more about his late student, and what he discovers both amazes and terrifies him. Who was Evan Parker, and how did he get the idea for his “sure thing” of a novel? What is the real story behind the plot, and who stole it from whom?\r\n\r\nRead more\r\nPrint length\r\n317 pages\r\nLanguage\r\nEnglish\r\nPublisher\r\nCeladon Books\r\nPublication date\r\nMay 11, 2021\r\nFile size\r\n4281 KB\r\nPage Flip\r\nEnabled\r\n\r\nAN INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR\r\nAt the risk of sounding too meta, how did you come up with the plot of The Plot?\r\n\r\nJEAN HANFF KORELITZ: Like most writers I’m fascinated by plagiarism and the murkiness around creative appropriation: chefs stealing recipes from other chefs, comedians helping themselves to other comedians’ jokes, academic theft, and above all creative writers appropriating work by others. I’m hardly the first novelist to write about this — there’s an entire sub-genre of Stephen King work on this theme — and it’s not the first time I’ve touched on it in my own work, but it’s the first time I’ve placed it front and center in a book. I think it makes sense to write about the things that fascinate us.\r\n\r\nThe Plot cover image\r\nWhile writing this book, you must have put yourself in the shoes of the main character. Do you think you’d ever steal a genius idea for a book if you knew it would never be used?\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t, but only because I’m squeamish by nature and I’d be terrified about that degree of exposure and disapproval. But like most artists, I also understand that stories run underneath the ground of our collective experience, and we all dip into them, whether we’re aware of it or not. The real question is: At what point does a collective story become the individual property of a person or an artist? A contender for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Drama was The Inheritance by Matthew Lopez, which openly adapts Forster’s Howards End to contemporary New York City. This is a normal, even laudatory practice, which artists fully understand. But to help yourself to the specific plot of a recently deceased author who never completed his book? I don’t know where the line is, exactly, but I’m pretty sure that’s over it.\r\n\r\nEditorial Reviews\r\nAmazon.com Review\r\nAn Amazon Best Book of May 2021: Jean Hanff Korelitz’s riveting novel is a story within a story that is a Rubik’s Cube of twists. Jake Finch Bonner is living a life he never expected. Instead of fame and fortune, this once-promising young author is teaching MFA seminars at an obscure university and barely making ends meet. Then abrasive, self-important Evan Parker arrives in Jake’s class with a one-of-a-kind plot that he’s confident will rocket him into the kind of success and stardom enjoyed by few in the literary world. And once Jake hears that story, he knows Evan is right, and Jake’s jealousy and self-pity are palpable. But Evan Parker doesn’t publish that book—Jake Bonner does. And someone knows whose plot he stole.

I’m hardly the first novelist to write about this — there’s an entire sub-genre of Stephen King work on this theme — and it’s not the first time I’ve touched on it in my own work, but it’s the first time I’ve placed it front and center in a book.

But like most artists, I also understand that stories run underneath the ground of our collective experience, and we all dip into them, whether we’re aware of it or not. The real question is: At what point does a collective story become the individual property of a person or an artist? A contender for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Drama was The Inheritance by Matthew Lopez, which openly adapts Forster’s Howards End to contemporary New York City. This is a normal, even laudatory practice, which artists fully understand. But to help yourself to the specific plot of a recently deceased author who never completed his book?

Jake Finch Bonner is living a life he never expected. Instead of fame and fortune, this once-promising young author is teaching MFA seminars at an obscure university and barely making ends meet. Then abrasive, self-important Evan Parker arrives in Jake’s class with a one-of-a-kind plot that he’s confident will rocket him into the kind of success and stardom enjoyed by few in the literary world. And once Jake hears that story, he knows Evan is right, and Jake’s jealousy and self-pity are palpable. But Evan Parker doesn’t publish that book—Jake Bonner does.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing, as featured in the HBO documentary Crime of the Century.\r\n\r\nThe Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions—Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis.\r\n\r\nEmpire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\r\n\r\nArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\r\n\r\nForty years later, Raymond’s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug’s addictiveness—was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die.\r\n\r\nThis is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d’Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.  Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.

Every time he writes a book, I read it. Every time he writes an article, I read it … he’s a national treasure.” - Rachel Maddow, host of MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” and author of the #1 New York Times bestselling Blowout\r\n\r\n“An engrossing (and frequently enraging) tale of striving, secrecy and self-delusion….Keefe nimbly guides us through the thicket of family intrigues and betrayals… Even when detailing the most sordid episodes, Keefe’s narrative voice is calm and admirably restrained, allowing his prodigious reporting to speak for itself. His portrait of the family is all the more damning for its stark lucidity.” - Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times\r\n \r\n“A true tragedy in multiple acts. It is the story of a family that lost its moorings and its morals… Written with novelistic family-dynasty and family-dynamic sweep, EMPIRE OF PAIN is a pharmaceutical FORSYTHE SAGA, a book that in its way is addictive, with a page-turning forward momentum.”  - David M. Shribman, The Boston Globe\r\n \r\n“A brutal, multigenerational treatment of the Sackler family… Keefe deepens the narrative by tracing the family's ambitions and ruthless methods back to the founding patriarch, Arthur Sackler…His life might be a model for the American dream, if it hadn't arguably laid the foundations for a still-unfolding national tragedy.”  - Brian Mann, NPR.org\r\n \r\n“The opioid epidemic has killed nearly half a million Americans over the past two decades. Many of their loved ones, along with public health advocates and experts, believe that one very rich, very famous family has never fully faced the consequences for its role in those deaths. EMPIRE OF PAIN, the explosive new book by journalist Patrick Radden Keefe, is an attempt to change that — to hold the family accountable in a way that nobody has quite done before, by telling its story as the saga of a dynasty driven by arrogance, avarice and indifference to mass suffering…. Keefe marshals a large pile of evidence and deploys it with prosecutorial precision.   Keefe is a gifted storyteller who excels at capturing personalities.” - Jonathan Cohn, The Washington Post\r\n\r\n\"Empire of Pain reads like a real-life thriller, a page-turner, a deeply shocking dissection of avarice and calculated callousness… It is the measure of great and fearless investigative writing that it achieves retribution where the law could not….Exhaustively researched and written with grace and gravity, Empire of Pain unpeels a most terrible American scandal. You feel almost guilty for enjoying it so much.\"  - The Times (London)\r\n\r\n\"Keefe has a way of making the inaccessible incredibly digestible, of morphing complex stories into page-turning thrillers, and he's done it again with Empire of Pain…A scathing — but meticulously reported — takedown of the extended family behind OxyContin, widely believed to be at the root cause of our nation's opioid crisis.  It's equal parts juicy society gossip and historical record of how they built their dynasty and eventually pushed Oxy onto the market.”  - Seija Rankin, Entertainment Weekly\r\n \r\n “An air-tight indictment of the family behind the opioid crisis….[an] impressive exposé.” - Harriet Ryan, The Los Angeles Times\r\n\r\n“A damning portrait of the Sacklers, the billionaire clan behind the OxyContin epidemic. If you are someone who engages in this kind of sneaky conduct, the last person you want reporting on you is Keefe….[He] has a knack for crafting lucid, readable descriptions of the sort of arcane business arrangements the Sacklers favored. He is also indefatigable….The Sackler infighting described in Empire of Pain will surely prompt many comparisons to the HBO series Succession.” - Laura Miller, Slate\r\n\r\n“Put simply, this book will make your blood boil….a devastating portrait of a family consumed by greed and unwilling to take the slightest responsibility or show the least sympathy for what it wrought….a highly readable and disturbing narrative.”  - John Carreyrou, The New York Times Book Review (cover)\r\n \r\n“A shocking saga… [a]tour-de-force account… [Keefe] brings to life the obsessive personalities and ferocious energy of some members…The Sacklers emerge as a shameless bunch, but Empire of Pain also poses troubling questions about the US healthcare system that permitted them to flourish.”  - John Gapper, The Financial Times\r\n\r\n“Rigorously reported and brilliantly executed Empire of Pain hones in on the family whose company developed, unleashed, and pushed the drug on Americans, pulling in billions of dollars for themselves in the process….This is an important, necessary book.” - Hillary Kelly, New York magazine\r\n\r\n\"Indefatigable investigative journalist Keefe crafts a page-turning corporate biography and jaw-dropping condemnation of the Sacklers’ amoral disregard for anything save the acquisition of power, privilege, and influence. In Keefe’s expert hands, the Sackler family saga becomes an enraging exposé of what happens when utter devotion to the accumulation of wealth is paired with an unscrupulous disregard for human health.\" - Carol Haggas, Booklist\r\n\r\n“An engrossing and deeply reported book about the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma. Their company created Oxycontin, the opioid introduced in the mid-90s that sent a wave of addiction and death across the country. Unlike previous books on the epidemic, Empire of Pain is focused on the wildly rich, ambitious and cutthroat family that built its empire first on medical advertising and later on painkillers. In his hands, their story becomes a great American morality tale about unvarnished greed dressed in ostentatious philanthropy.” - Time Magazine, The Best Books of 2021 So Far\r\nAmazon.com Review\r\n\r\nEditors' pick: The true story of the Sackler family and OxyContin is Game of Thrones-level stuff, and it’s fascinating.\"—Chris Schluep, Amazon Editor --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.\r\nRead more\r\nProduct details\r\nASIN ‏ : ‎ B08ND91K6G\r\nPublisher ‏ : ‎ Doubleday (April 13, 2021)\r\nPublication date ‏ : ‎ April 13, 2021\r\nLanguage ‏ : ‎ English\r\nFile size ‏ : ‎ 8615 KB\r\nText-to-Speech ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nScreen Reader ‏ : ‎ Supported\r\nEnhanced typesetting ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nX-Ray ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nWord Wise ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nPrint length ‏ : ‎ 558 pages\r\nLending ‏ : ‎ Not Enabled\r\nBest Sellers Rank: #954 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)\r\n#1 in Biographies of White Collar Crime\r\n#1 in Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology Industry (Kindle Store)\r\n#3 in White Collar Crime True Accounts\r\nCustomer Reviews: 4.7 out of 5 stars    3,216 ratings\r\nVideos\r\nHelp others learn more about this product by uploading a video!\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\nFollow authors to get new release updates, plus improved recommendations.\r\n\r\nFollow\r\nPatrick Radden Keefe\r\nPatrick Radden Keefe is an award-winning staff writer at The New Yorker magazine and the author of Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland, as well as two previous critically acclaimed books, The Snakehead, and Chatter.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing, as featured in the HBO documentary Crime of the Century.\r\n\r\nThe Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions—Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis.\r\n\r\nEmpire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\r\n\r\nArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\r\n\r\nForty years later, Raymond’s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug’s addictiveness—was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die.\r\n\r\nThis is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d’Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.  Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability. The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama—baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\r\n\r\nEmpire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling.

Keefe is a gifted storyteller who excels at capturing personalities.” - Jonathan Cohn, The Washington Post\r\n\r\n\"Empire of Pain reads like a real-life thriller, a page-turner, a deeply shocking dissection of avarice and calculated callousness… It is the measure of great and fearless investigative writing that it achieves retribution where the law could not….Exhaustively researched and written with grace and gravity, Empire of Pain unpeels a most terrible American scandal. You feel almost guilty for enjoying it so much.\"  - The Times (London)\r\n\r\n\"Keefe has a way of making the inaccessible incredibly digestible, of morphing complex stories into page-turning thrillers, and he's done it again with Empire of Pain…A scathing — but meticulously reported — takedown of the extended family behind OxyContin, widely believed to be at the root cause of our nation's opioid crisis.  It's equal parts juicy society gossip and historical record of how they built their dynasty and eventually pushed Oxy onto the market.”  - Seija Rankin, Entertainment Weekly\r\n \r\n “An air-tight indictment of the family behind the opioid crisis….[an] impressive exposé.” - Harriet Ryan, The Los Angeles Times\r\n\r\n“A damning portrait of the Sacklers, the billionaire clan behind the OxyContin epidemic. If you are someone who engages in this kind of sneaky conduct, the last person you want reporting on you is Keefe….[He] has a knack for crafting lucid, readable descriptions of the sort of arcane business arrangements the Sacklers favored. He is also indefatigable….The Sackler infighting described in Empire of Pain will surely prompt many comparisons to the HBO series Succession.” - Laura Miller, Slate\r\n\r\n“Put simply, this book will make your blood boil….a devastating portrait of a family consumed by greed and unwilling to take the slightest responsibility or show the least sympathy for what it wrought….a highly readable and disturbing narrative.”  - John Carreyrou, The New York Times Book Review (cover)\r\n \r\n“A shocking saga… [a]tour-de-force account… [Keefe] brings to life the obsessive personalities and ferocious energy of some members…The Sacklers emerge as a shameless bunch, but Empire of Pain also poses troubling questions about the US healthcare system that permitted them to flourish.”  - John Gapper, The Financial Times\r\n\r\n“Rigorously reported and brilliantly executed Empire of Pain hones in on the family whose company developed, unleashed, and pushed the drug on Americans, pulling in billions of dollars for themselves in the process….This is an important, necessary book.” - Hillary Kelly, New York magazine\r\n\r\n\"Indefatigable investigative journalist Keefe crafts a page-turning corporate biography and jaw-dropping condemnation of the Sacklers’ amoral disregard for anything save the acquisition of power, privilege, and influence. In Keefe’s expert hands, the Sackler family saga becomes an enraging exposé of what happens when utter devotion to the accumulation of wealth is paired with an unscrupulous disregard for human health.\" - Carol Haggas, Booklist\r\n\r\n“An engrossing and deeply reported book about the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma. Their company created Oxycontin, the opioid introduced in the mid-90s that sent a wave of addiction and death across the country. Unlike previous books on the epidemic, Empire of Pain is focused on the wildly rich, ambitious and cutthroat family that built its empire first on medical advertising and later on painkillers. In his hands, their story becomes a great American morality tale about unvarnished greed dressed in ostentatious philanthropy.” - Time Magazine, The Best Books of 2021 So Far\r\nAmazon.com Review\r\n\r\nEditors' pick: The true story of the Sackler family and OxyContin is Game of Thrones-level stuff, and it’s fascinating.\"—Chris Schluep, Amazon Editor --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.\r\nRead more\r\nProduct details\r\nASIN ‏ : ‎ B08ND91K6G\r\nPublisher ‏ : ‎ Doubleday (April 13, 2021)\r\nPublication date ‏ : ‎ April 13, 2021\r\nLanguage ‏ : ‎ English\r\nFile size ‏ : ‎ 8615 KB\r\nText-to-Speech ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nScreen Reader ‏ : ‎ Supported\r\nEnhanced typesetting ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nX-Ray ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nWord Wise ‏ : ‎ Enabled\r\nPrint length ‏ : ‎ 558 pages\r\nLending ‏ : ‎ Not Enabled\r\nBest Sellers Rank: #954 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)\r\n#1 in Biographies of White Collar Crime\r\n#1 in Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology Industry (Kindle Store)\r\n#3 in White Collar Crime True Accounts\r\nCustomer Reviews: 4.7 out of 5 stars    3,216 ratings\r\nVideos\r\nHelp others learn more about this product by uploading a video!\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\nFollow authors to get new release updates, plus improved recommendations.\r\n\r\nFollow\r\nPatrick Radden Keefe\r\nPatrick Radden Keefe is an award-winning staff writer at The New Yorker magazine and the author of Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland, as well as two previous critically acclaimed books, The Snakehead, and Chatter.

Opioids, and their marketing, were the slipperiest of slopes and the nation skidded down the hill.\r\n\r\nAs a doc, I knew of the overprescribing in the late 1990's and wondered how a \"controlled substance\" could make it from the factory to the streets with such ease. Now I know. At least I never wrote a script for it and never took a single dose of this poison.\r\n\r\nEvil. Pure, homegrown, evil. Aided and abetted by lawyers, and even McKinsey. NO ONE bothered to say what everyone knew: there was no excuse for the flood of opioids. No excuse except the addiction to money.\r\n\r\nThe overdoses and deaths came early. Having been introduced to medical doctors in the mid to late 1990’s, the super strong pain medicine, OxyContin, quickly became the drug of choice to give those dying in great pain from cancer. But OxyContin soon led to chronic abuse among those seeking the highs of street drugs. What was OxyContin and who was behind the mounting death toll? In his new book, “Empire of Pain”, author Patrick Radden Keefe, takes the reader behind the scenes to the ultra-secretive Sackler family.\r\n\r\nWhen (and if) you to the Smithsonian Museum, you’ll see huge Sackler Gallery, dedicated to Asian Art. There are similar rooms filled with donations at prestigious colleges and museums, mostly in the northeast. They were gifts given by members of the Sackler family. The three brothers, Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond, were sons of a Jewish immigrant family. The brothers all became doctors and were primarily interested in psychiatry. But they ended up leaving the treatment of patients for the more lucrative business of...business. The three - but in particular, Arthur - founded drug advertising agencies, and then drug companies. They produced some good sellers, like Senokot, but hit the big time with the development of the incredibly strong pain killer, OxyContin. It was sold as specifically “non addictive”. But, it was"
