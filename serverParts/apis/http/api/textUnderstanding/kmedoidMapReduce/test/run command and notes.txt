Version tested on Ubuntu 18.4 - Linux - locally
	On Windows fails during execution - mrjob tutorial script fails too,...

Startup
python3 kmedoidsMR.py

requirements:
python3
python3-pip
mrjob


Local hadoop setup:
https://tecadmin.net/install-hadoop-on-ubuntu-20-04/


Addditional configuration
	-number of iterations can be reduced using script

Dependencies
	-only mrjob library is required

Notes
	-every iteration is improvement of previous ones and can be used separately or as new starting point
		-set iteration number to script
		-or only change number behind clusters (clusters.txt) to 0 (clusters0.txt) 
			and the same for number behind data (data0.txt) 
				(napr. data15.txt -> data0.txt, clusters15.txt -> clusters0.txt)
	-algorith overwrites existing files in dictionary
	-in other files are approach to call only one script - hadoop wont start using it
	-files cant be opened in mapper or any init method (reducer_init, mapper_init,...) except class init
	-reducer is only one to recalculate centers from whole - file can be used here - MUST BE DECLARED IN FILES ARRAY
	-mrjob manages output and this can be used for local result files creation - on end device
